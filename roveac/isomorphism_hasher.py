Isomorphism Hashers
=========================

This module provides the `IsomorphismHasher` class, which defines a method
for hashing a graph to check for isomorphisms among known keys in a dictionary.

Classes
-------
IsomorphismHasher
    Class for hashing graphs and checking for isomorphisms.

class IsomorphismHasher:
    """
    Class for hashing graphs and retrieving matching isomorphic keys.

    Methods
    -------
    hash(G: nx.Graph, D: dict, method: str) -> tuple[list, dict]
        Hashes the given graph and returns a list of matching isomorphic keys from the dictionary.
    """

        """
        Takes in a graph known to be among the keys of `D` and hashes it, returning
        a matching list of isomorphic keys and the corresponding isomorphism data.

        The last key in the returned list should represent a graph for the time being.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : nx.Graph
            The graph to be hashed and checked for isomorphisms.
        D : dict
            A dictionary where keys are graph representations to check for isomorphism with `G`.
        method : str
            Denotes which method to use to hash.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple[list, dict]
            A tuple containing:
            
            - A list of keys in `D` that are isomorphic to `G`.
            - A dictionary representing the isomorphism data for the matches.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : nx.Graph

        -------
        tuple[list, dict]
            A list containing the hash key and matched graph, and the isomorphism mapping.
